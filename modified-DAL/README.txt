    source/types/MicroBitImage.cpp      lines 40-167 and every printing function


Lines 40-167:
    This senses the I2C LED driver and if present it creates and initialises the I2C communication protocol. Note that this is unique to the HT16K33 LED matrix driver. The I2C matrix printing function is also defined here.
 
    
    
TO DO:
    Add setPixelValue brightness function
    Implement rotation function
    Tidy and optimise
    
DONE:
    Run I2C display from DAL
    Implement changes to print function (for printing characters)
    Implement changes to paste function (for printing images)
    Make paste function not clear whole display before printing
    Implement setPixelValue function
    Add setPixelValue on and off function
    Implement brightness function
    Add I2C device sensing
    Implement changes to animation event (to handle scrolling text)
