# Mega-Bit project by Imperial College EEE students

The purpose of this project is to design and build a teaching aid for use with the BBC Micro:Bit. Its base requirements are to take a student's micro:bit and mirror their code on a larger scale for the whole class to see.

Current product model: The mega:bit will essentially be an external I2C LED matrix with large buttons and the micro:bits GPIO pins also broken out. The micro:bit will use the reserved accessibility pin to 'sense' when it is connected to the mega:bit and needs to sed I2C information. The exact details of this are yet to be decided.
